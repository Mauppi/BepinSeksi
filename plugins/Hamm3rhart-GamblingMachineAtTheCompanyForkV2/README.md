# Gambling Is the Only Way

This is a fork of a fork.
First fork: [GamblingMachineAtTheCompanyFork](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Kaza/GamblingMachineAtTheCompanyFork)
Original: [GamblingMachineAtTheCompany](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/JunLethalCompany/GamblingMachineAtTheCompany)

I wanted to add more customization to the mod and had some feature/quality-of-life ideas.

All credit goes to the original creator and the first fork’s author for updating it to the current version.

## Description

"To make your ambitions come true, you have to take risks."

Adds gambling machines at "The Company" moon. You'll see them right in front of you when you land.

The gamble roll can have 6 results (all configurable):

- Jackpot = 10x
- Triple = 3x
- Double = 2x
- Halve = 0.5x (scrap reduced by half)
- Zero = 0x (scrap is worthless)
- Explode = 0x (what do you think will happen?)

The default gambling chances (these are configurable):

- Jackpot = 3%
- Triple = 11%
- Double = 27%
- Halve = 49%
- Zero = 9%
- Explode = 1%

## How to use the gambling machine

While holding a scrap, walk up to the machine and press "E" (or your interaction key).
